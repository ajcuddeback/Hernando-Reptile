                    <h2>Lauren Morello</h2>
                    <h3>President/Founder </h3>
                    <p class="margin-top">Lauren Morello is originally from Long Island, NY. Her passion for rescuing
                        animals in need began
                        at a very young age. At the age of 6 she rescued her first pet, a Dutch bunny named Thumper. He
                        was the first of what would eventually turn into thousands of rescues of animals of every size,
                        shape, color, and species. As a teenager, Lauren worked as a veterinary assistant in an
                        all-species day practice, as well as a veterinary technician at the North Shore Animal League
                        America, the world’s largest no-kill animal rescue organization. By the time she was 16, she had
                        her own rescued colony of 6 bunnies, a cat who had been abandoned at just two days old, a
                        Patterdale terrier that had produced nearly a dozen litters for the puppy mill she was
                        originally owned by until they had no more use for her and left her for dead, several ferrets,
                        some guinea pigs, a hedgehog, and a beautiful American Saddlebred that was once bound for a
                        Mexican slaughterhouse.
                    </p>
                    <p class="margin-top">
                        At 17 she, along with her horse Mr. Beans, left home to attend the University of Findlay as a
                        double major in both English Equestrian studies and Pre-veterinary Medicine. During her freshman
                        year, as part of her animal handling class, Lauren raised a Holstein/Guernsey steer which she
                        ultimately purchased to avoid having him go to market. While in college, she opened her home to
                        several unwanted dogs, pocket pet, and even her first pot belly pig. Although a drunk driver cut
                        her college career short during her junior year, she continued to perform animal rescues
                        throughout the three years she was in school and well beyond. After leaving school, she
                        purchased a farm in Hagerstown, IN and took in dozens of unwanted dogs, cats, horses, pigs, and
                        chickens.</p>
                    <p class='margin-top'>A year later she relocated
                        to Florida where the rescue efforts continued. Lauren started out as a foster home housing as
                        many as 19 American pit bull terriers at one time.
                        Since then, she helped run a dog and
                        cat rescue in the Tampa Bay area, held jobs with Pasco County and the Florida Highway Patrol
                        saving lives as a dispatcher, received acclaim from Cesar Millan (“The Dog Whisperer”) for her
                        work with a special needs dog named Xander (<a

                        finally establishing Hernando Reptile and Exotics Rescue in 2019 which has received both Bronze
                        and Silver awards in the Hernando Sun’s Readers Choice awards in 2019 and 2020, and obtained the prestigious Gold Award in 2022. Lauren also is a
                        member of the Hernando County Fire & Emergency Services Venom Response Unit, helping to remove
                        venomous reptiles and other wildlife from dangerous situations.</p>

                    <h2>Joseph Colao</h2>
                    <h3>Vice President/Co-Founder</h3>

                    <p class="margin-top">Joseph is originally from Selden, NY and moved to Florida in the winter of 2004. His love and
                        passion for animals of all kinds started at a very young age. He was constantly in trouble for
                        bringing home stray dogs, cats, and even wild birds! As a former president and vice-president of
                        two local dog rescues, Joseph was honored to help Lauren create what is now Hernando Reptile and
                        Exotics Rescue and work with “some of the best people in rescue and my favorite cold and
                        warm-blooded animals.” His work history has always been about helping – working for the Middle
                        Country School District and Independent Group Home Living (IGHL) back on Long Island, NY. Joe
                        can always be found at our events touting the largest reptiles we have around so everyone, young
                        and old alike, can gain an education about these magnificent creatures!</p>

                    <p class="margin-top">Jesse was elected to our Board in January of 2020, and took on a multitude of
                        responsibilities…
                        officially as Secretary/Treasurer, but also wearing the hats of Volunteer Coordinator and Social
                        Media Lead, all while volunteering much time and energy taking care of the Rescue ambassadors

                    <h2>Dan Groover</h2>
                    <h3>Director of Veterinary Care / Social Media Manager</h3>

                    <p class="margin-top">Dan has been working with animals since she was 13 by starting at her hometown zoo, then
                        continued at a wildlife rehabilitation hospital as well as a big cat sanctuary, all before
                        stepping into the veterinary world. She graduated from FSU in 2014 and has 8 years of vet tech
                        experience from general practice to emergency/critical care. For the last 2 years she has been
                        focused on exotic animal medicine. She has extensive knowledge on proper husbandry/dietary needs
                        for exotic animals and loves to share that knowledge with others.</p>
                    <p class="margin-top">Dan recently moved to the Tampa bay area with her fiance and all of their
                        animals. She heard
                        the call for volunteers, joined up and became immediately active in all aspects of the rescue,
                        wherever she could help. Most importantly, Dan has been instrumental in providing the TLC needed
                        for some very sick intakes, saving the lives of several neglected and special needs reptiles.
                        She is excited to help the rescue expand and make sure the animals receive medical care and
                        excellent nutrition during their stay and we are thrilled to have her in such an important role.
