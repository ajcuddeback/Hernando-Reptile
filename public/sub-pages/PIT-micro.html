                UPDATE: As of late September, Bill 1414 was deemed unconstitutional by a Florida Circuit Court Judge,
                and the ban on Tegus and Iguanas was lifted. However, FWC is still planning on sweeping changes to the
                rules on possession of non-native conditional and non-conditional species and will be meeting in
                February 2021 to discuss rule changes. It is our <span class="bold">STRONG recommendation</span> that
                you keep aware of these
                upcoming changes to FWC rules, and get your reptiles chipped in advance of these rules. We are now
                offering our microchipping services to all reptiles and exotic animals that are able to be chipped for
                the same $25 cost that we originally offered only to Tegus and Green Iguanas. Please contact us for an
                appointment today!
            <p>
                We are keeping the information below here so you can see a history of why we began offering this
                service:
            </p>
            </p>
            <p class="center-text small-text indent">On July 1, 2020, the Florida State Senate Bill 1414 was enacted
                into
                law as Executive
                order
                20-19,
                effectively banning the possession and trade of Green Iguanas (Iguana iguana and all morphs
                of
                this
                species)
                and Tegus (all species in the genera Salvator and Tupinambis). As such, the Florida Fish and
                Wildlife
                Conservation Commission (also known as FWC) is requiring that all individuals or entities
                that
                were
                in
                possession of these species not already grandfathered in are to apply to be able to keep
                their
                pets.
                The
                FWC
                website says: <span class="italic">"Per EO 20-19, individuals who had a pet green iguana or
                    tegu
                    prior
                    to
                    July 1, 2020 can apply
                    for a Prohibited Species for Personal Use Permit to lawfully possess that animal for the
                    remainder
                    of
                    its
                    life."</span></p>
            <p class="small-text center-text margin-top padding-top indent">In short: If you owned a pet
                green
                iguana or tegu BEFORE
                July
                1,
                2020, you MUST
                apply
                for
                this
                permit to continually legally possess your pet. If you want to obtain a Tegu or Green Iguana
                (or
                any
                morph
                of these) after July 1, 2020, it is now illegal to obtain one in the State of Florida by ANY
                means.
            </p>
            <p class="small-text center-text indent">If you have any question as to whether you were automatically
                grandfathered in, you
                most
                likely
                were
                NOT
                grandfathered in... only 150 business entities that held a Class III permit were given this
                status.
                Our
                Rescue was not even grandfathered in, and we are having to apply for a pet permit just like
                you.
            </p>
            <p class="small-text center-text indent">
                Additionally, the new rules require each animal affected by the ban be PIT tagged BEFORE
                submitting
                this
                form.</p>
            <p class="center-text small-text indent">We know that as responsible pet owners, this changing of
                the law may
                be
                adversely
                effecting
                you
                financially,
                especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to many of our friends, we hear that some
                veterinarians
                are asking as much as $300 PER Iguana or Tegu to provide PIT tagging!</p>
            <p class="center-text padding-top ">Lauren Bertke, our rescue President, was a Veterinary Technician for 20
                years, and
                has
                experience
                giving
                PIT
                tags to various mammals and reptiles, so when she heard of the requirement, she authorized
                the
                rescue to
                procure PIT tags from 911 PetChip and we are pleased to offer PIT tagging to all those
                affected
                by
                the
                new
                FWC requirements for only $25 per animal! We use "TinyChips" using a small 16 gauge needle,
                so
                even
                your
                young animals can be tagged. The $25 price even includes FREE Lifetime
                Registration though
                FreePetChipRegistry.com! Any proceeds from tagging will go directly into procuring as many
                chips
                as
                are
                needed. </p>
