            <h1>How does my donation help?</h1>
            <p>Our mission is to promote the health and well-being of abused, neglected, unwanted, and abandoned native
                and non-native reptiles and exotic animals through rescue, rehabilitation, education, and community
                outreach, while preserving the native Florida ecosystem and preventing release of invasive species.
            </p>
            <p>Our organization not only rescues animals, but focuses on the education of Florida youth and adults about
                the importance of thoroughly researching all exotic animals before obtaining one as a pet, the
                seriousness of caring for an animal (especially an exotic as they require more specialized care than
                domestic pets), and preventing the release of invasive species into the Florida ecosystem. We provide
                all educational demonstrations at no charge to anyone and everyone who requests one. All of our work is
                funded by voluntary donations and adoption fees.</p>
            <p>We intake, rehabilitate and find forever homes for reptiles, amphibians and exotic non-native animals,
                oftentimes having over 100 animals staying with us at any given time. Upon intake, each animal is
                assessed for a variety of medical issues, including neurological disorders, metabolic bone disease, and
                a host of other common issues that we see with animals that are abused, abandoned or confiscated. Then
                we provide rehabilitation to the best of our abilities to stabilize any quality of life concerns. We are
                dedicated and proud to be a "no-kill" rescue, so many of our animals who are unable to be re-homed due
                to health or geriatric issues will be with us for the rest of their natural lives. However, if an
                animal's quality of life is diminished to a point where keeping it alive would be inhumane, euthanasia
                may be necessary.
            </p>
            <p>We help hundreds of animals each year regain their quality of life and find forever homes - but this
                undertaking is costly. Our rescue spends anywhere between $600-$1000 per month or more on the care of
                our residents, and this doesn't include occasional veterinary expenses. We are a federally recognized
                501(c)(3) non profit organization, fully incorporated by the State of Florida and hold all appropriate
                licensing from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. To see our licensing and
