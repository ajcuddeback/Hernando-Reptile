                <p>Do you have a passion for animals? So do we!!! Hernando Reptile and Exotics Rescue, Inc. is 100% run
                    by
                    volunteers, from the top down! Not one of our Board Members are paid, and, in fact, during slow
                    financial
                    times, our Board Members are the ones financially supporting the daily care of our residents. </p>
                <p>As many of you may know, our rescue is run out of our home in a residential neighborhood in the
                    middle of Spring Hill, Florida. In times of high population, you can't turn a corner without meeting
                    several of our temporary residents or Ambassadors. â€‹Hernando Reptile and Exotics Rescue, Inc. is the
                    brainchild of Lauren Bertke who realized that there was a desperate need to shelter unwanted
                    reptiles and other non-native species in our area when she personally rescued "Cookie" in May of
                    2017 as well as "Mitch" and "Merida" in 2018, all who were Columbian Red Tailed Boas. At the end of
                    2018, three snakes (2 carpet pythons and one Bredli python) were given to her in a large Rubbermaid
                    container with just pot of water after their temporary owner did everything they could to take care
                    of them. What started out as 6 beautiful snakes became a multitude of over 100 animals, from snakes
                    to tortoises, leopard geckos to a blue arctic fox, iguanas to tegus.</p>
                <p>As you can imagine, running a rescue of over 100 animals in a 3 bedroom home can be a quite daunting
                    task. Keeping it clean and smelling fresh is even more difficult. This is why we need you!!! We need
                    people who will go the extra mile, aren't afraid of getting dirty, and will work hard to ensure the
                    well being and safety of every one of our residents.
