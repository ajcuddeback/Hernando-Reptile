            <p class="center-text">Do you have a passion for animals? So do we!!! Hernando Reptile and Exotics Rescue,
                Inc. is
                100%
                run
                by
                volunteers, from the top down! Not one of our Board Members are paid, and, in fact, during
                slow
                financial
                times, our Board Members are the ones financially supporting the daily care of our
                residents.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text">As many of you may know, our rescue is run out of our home in a residential
                neighborhood in
                the
                middle of Spring Hill, Florida. In times of high population, you can't turn a corner without
                meeting
                several of our temporary residents or Ambassadors. â€‹Hernando Reptile and Exotics Rescue,
                Inc. is
                the
                brainchild of Lauren Bertke who realized that there was a desperate need to shelter unwanted
                reptiles and other non-native species in our area when she personally rescued "Cookie" in
                May of
                2017 as well as "Mitch" and "Merida" in 2018, all who were Columbian Red Tailed Boas. At the
                end
                of
                2018, three snakes (2 carpet pythons and one Bredli python) were given to her in a large
                Rubbermaid
                container with just pot of water after their temporary owner did everything they could to
                take
                care
                of them. What started out as 6 beautiful snakes became a multitude of over 100 animals, from
                snakes
                to tortoises, leopard geckos to a blue arctic fox, iguanas to tegus.</p>
            <p class="center-text">As you can imagine, running a rescue of over 100 animals in a 3 bedroom home can be a
                quite
                daunting
                task. Keeping it clean and smelling fresh is even more difficult. This is why we need you!!!
                We
                need
                people who will go the extra mile, aren't afraid of getting dirty, and will work hard to
                ensure
                the
                well being and safety of every one of our residents.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text">Because we are a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, all volunteer hours
                performed here are
                accepted as credit for schools, scholarships and community service hours (we will accept volunteers
                for
                court-ordered non-violent offenders on a case-by-case basis). While we are looking for individuals

                and
                older, we will accept students younger than 18 on occassion, but require parental permission. </p>
